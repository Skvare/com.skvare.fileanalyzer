## Architecture

### Scheduled Scanning Process
```
CRM_Fileanalyzer_API_FileAnalysis::scheduledScan()
    ‚Üì
1. Scan custom file upload directory recursively
2. Check each file against database references
3. Generate comprehensive analysis data
4. Store results in JSON files:
   - latest_scan_results.json (complete scan data)
   - abandoned_files.json (abandoned files only)
   - scan_results_[timestamp].json (historical data)
5. Perform auto-deletion if configured
```

### Dashboard Display Process
```
CRM_Fileanalyzer_Page_Dashboard::run()
    ‚Üì
1. Read stored JSON files
2. Check if scan data exists
3. If no data: Prompt to run scheduled job
4. If data exists: Process and display analytics
5. Generate charts and statistics
```

## Usage

### Dashboard Access
Navigate to **Administer ‚Üí System Settings ‚Üí File Analyzer**

### Dashboard Features

### Generated Data Files
Located in `[customFileUploadDir]/file_analyzer_backups/`:
```
file_analyzer_backups/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ latest_scan_results.json          # Most recent complete scan
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ abandoned_files.json              # Current abandoned files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scan_results_[timestamp].json     # Historical scans
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deleted_files/                    # Backup of deleted files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/                          # Generated reports
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .htaccess                         # Security protection
```

## Database Integration

### File Usage Detection
The extension checks multiple sources to determine if a file is in use:

1. **civicrm_file table**: Direct file attachments
2. **Custom field tables**: File-type custom fields
3. **civicrm_entity_file**: Activity and entity attachments

## Security Considerations

### File Protection
- Backup directory protected with `.htaccess`
- JSON files contain paths but no sensitive content
- Only administrators can access the dashboard
- Deleted files are backed up before removal

### Permissions Required
- **CiviCRM Administer**: View dashboard and reports
- **CiviCRM Administer**: Configure settings and trigger scans

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Scan Results Displayed
**Problem**: Dashboard shows "No files found, ask to run scheduled job"
**Solution**:
1. Check if scheduled job is configured and running
2. Manually trigger scan via API or dashboard
3. Verify custom file upload directory permissions

#### Scheduled Job Fails
**Problem**: Scan job fails with errors
**Solution**:
1. Check CiviCRM log files for detailed errors
2. Verify file system permissions on upload directory
3. Ensure backup directory is writable
4. Check PHP memory limits for large directories

#### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Dashboard loads slowly
**Solution**:
1. Ensure using JSON-cached data, not live scanning
2. Increase PHP memory limit if needed
3. Consider excluding large file types from scanning
